# Privacy Policy for Vaultage (Windows Application)

**Effective Date:** 5 October 2021

At Vaultage, your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy describes how Vaultage handles your data.

## 1. No Data Collection

Vaultage does **not collect**, transmit, or share any personal data.
All information you store using Vaultage remains **entirely under your control** and is either:

- Stored **locally on your Windows device**, or

- Stored **in your personal OneDrive account**, if you choose to enable cloud sync

We do not have access to any of your stored content, metadata, or usage activity.

## 2. Local and Cloud Storage

- **Local Storage:** All data is stored securely on your computer. Vaultage does not transmit this data externally.

- **OneDrive (optional):** If you enable cloud synchronization, your data is stored in your personal OneDrive account, managed by Microsoft. Vaultage only facilitates this storage and does not access your OneDrive contents.

## 3. No Analytics, No Ads, No Tracking

Vaultage contains:

- **No advertisements**

- **No telemetry or analytics**

- **No third-party trackers**

Your activity within the app stays private and on your device.

## 4. Security

Vaultage uses strong encryption methods to protect your stored data. However, the security of your files also depends on how you protect your device and OneDrive account (e.g., passwords, 2FA).

We encourage you to keep your system up-to-date and follow best practices for digital security.

## 5. Your Control

You have full control over your data:

- Vaultage allows you to view or delete your information at any time.

- Uninstalling the application automatically delete your locally stored.

- Uninstalling the application does not automatically delete your OneDrive data.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Vaultage is not intended for children under 13. We do not collect any information, so no child-specific data is gathered.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If we ever update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you via the app or our website and revise the “Effective Date” above. However, any updates will maintain our commitment to not collecting or selling your data.
